##Solutions  
1) Write a query that returns the number of unique users per client per month

SELECT client_id,
   MONTH(time_id) as month,
   COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as users_num
FROM fact_events
GROUP BY client_id, MONTH(time_id)
  
2) Write a query that will calculate the number of shipments per month. The unique key for one shipment is a combination of shipment_id and sub_id. Output the year_month in format YYYY-MM and the number of shipments in that month.

SELECT FORMAT(shipment_date, 'yyyy-MM') AS year_month,
    -- CONVERT(varchar(7), shipment_date, 120) AS year_month -- Another way
   COUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(shipment_id,sub_id )) as unique_id
FROM amazon_shipment
GROUP BY FORMAT(shipment_date, 'yyyy-MM');
